# Random Agent Spoofer ![RAS icon](https://github.com/dillbyrne/random-agent-spoofer/blob/master/data/images/icon.png "RAS icon")

## For now if you want to try this WebExtension, you have to use Firefox Nightly or Developper Edition and load (the Preference API WebExtension Experiment)[https://github.com/Mylainos/preferences-experiment] in about:debugging

RAS is a privacy enhancing firefox addon which aims to hinder browser fingerprinting. It does this by changing the browser/device profile on a timer. Each browser profile has been tailored to match the actual values used by the target browser as much as possible, within the limits set by firefox.

It also supports other privacy enhancing options.

This document was last updated for 0.9.5.2 release.
